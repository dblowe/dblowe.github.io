				<strong></strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Story</strong></span>
				</p>
				<p>
				Connecting Context:<br />
				From marriage to Harris, Jonathan (1800). Significant material connecting Elizabeth to Jonathan.
				</p>
				<p>
				Elizabeth Baker was born around 1802 in Sussex, England. There are various possibilities, none of which have yet been confirmed [Note 1].
				</p>
				<p>
				Elizabeth married Jonathan Harris on 17th Nov 1821 in Mayfield, Sussex and then had three children: Jonathan jnr (bap. 10 Mar 1822 in Mayfield), Elizabeth (~1824) and Henry (~1825). On 28th Feb 1825 Jonathan (aged ~24) committed burglary (in Uckfield) and was subsequently tried (on 23 Mar 1825) at Horsham Sussex Assizes and was sentenced to be hanged but was reprieved for transportation for life to NSW. Jonathan was subsequently held on a prison hulk at Portsmouth and then on 15th Aug 1825 he was transferred to the convict ship Marquis of Hastings and left for Australia.
				</p>
				<p>
				Around 5 years later, Elizabeth (with her three young children, Jonathan jnr, now ~9, Elizabeth jnr ~7 and Henry ~6) departed England for Australia aboard the female convict ship Kains, though as a free women, not a convict [Note 2]. She arrived in NSW on 11 Mar 1831 and rejoined Jonathan snr. The family appears to have initially still been in the area around Clydesdale where Jonathan was located (see his story).
				</p>
				<p>
				The family appears to have moved soon afterwards, as a subsequent labor exemption, dated 2 January 1832 (and described as replacing the previous one) lists their location as Parramatta, but with this crossed out and a note indicating "to be received for Argyle (bide)? letter from Parramatta 19 Jan 1833" (i.e. a move to the Mittagong area in early 1833).
				</p>
				<p>
				During the period from 1831, when Elizabeth arrived in NSW, and 1836, she and Jonathan had 3 more children: Sophia (b. 15/1/1832), Thomas (b. 13/7/1833) and George (b. 19/8/1835) - all baptised at Parramatta [Note 3].
				</p>
				<p>
				In 30th Mar 1836 Elizabeth (who was now in her early 30s) was travelling from Bong Bong to Campbelltown in a cart, and was killed when the cart overturned somewhere around Bringelly. The cart was being driven by "a young lad, her son" (so possibly Jonathan jnr, who would now be aged 14) and with "an infant in her arms" (so probably George, aged 7 months).
				</p>
				<p>
				The accident was described in a newspaper report as follows (The Sydney Gazette and NSW Advertiser, 2-Apr-1836):
				</p>
				<p>
				"Dreadful Accident - On Wednesday last, as a cart containing a woman and infant child, driven by a lad the son of the woman, was proceeding from Bong Bong to Campbelltown on the way to the market, the lad allowed the horse to swerve from the road, and coming on a ridge capsized it, when awful to relate, the woman fell under the cart, and was crushed to death; the feelings of the lad, who was unable to raise the cart from off his dying parent can be better imagined than pourtrayed. Sometime after, the mail passing, rendered all the assistance possible, but the hand of death had marked the unfortunate woman for his victim; all aid was vain; the child, strange to say, escaped uninjured. A coroner's inquest was convened at the time our informant left Campbelltown, the result of which we are not aware of."
				</p>
				<p>
				A letter from the Police Magistrate to the Governor (Colonial Secretary Correspondence 36/2944 - 2nd/Apr/1836) states:
				</p>
				<p>
				"Police Office Stonequarry 1st Apr 1836<br />
				Sir, I have the honour to report for the information of his Excellencey the Governor that on Wednesday morning last a woman of the name Elizabeth Harris free, wife I understand of a Ticket of Leave holder residing near Mr Shelley's farm on the Goulburn road, met her death by the overturning of her Cart on the road between this and Myrtle Creek, She had a young baby in her arms who Providentially escaped unhurt. She has left a husband and five Children and joined him from England about five years back.<br />
				I would beg leave to take this opportunity to call His Excellency's attention to the bad state of the road where this accident happened, It is but a short distance, but I consider it a part of the Argyle Road that requires the most repair.<br />
				I have the honor To be Sir Your Most Obedient Servant HC* Antill Police Magistrate".
				</p>
				<p>
				The death was recorded at Cobbitty, with the death certificate giving her age as 31 (which, if accurate, would put her birth as ~1805, and so ~16 when she married). The burial location is unknown.
				</p>
				<p>
				It is not known how Jonathan looked after his children over the subsequent few years, though his older children would have been old enough to assist (Jonathan 14 and Elizabeth 12). Elizabeth's husband, Jonathan, ended up marrying twice more and having another 10 children. He lived another 55 years, and died in Benalla at the age of 91.
				</p>

				Note 1:<br />
				Various internet trees list different parents, dates and locations of birth for Elizabeth, including:<br />
					- John Baker and Elizabeth Weller - b. 26/12/1802, Uckfield / Framfield<br />
					- John Baker and Elizabeth Weller - b. 1805<br />
					- John Baker and Sarah Chapman - b. 26/12/1802, Uckfield / Framfield<br />
					- John Baker and Sarah Chapman - b. 1803, Framfield<br />
				See http://trees.ancestry.com.au/tree/4738801/family?cfpid=-1537708459. This trees lists a significant family history for Elizabeth, and that she was born in Uckfield, 26/2/1806, though this appears to have been taken from another tree which has base din on the 1851 census (after Elizabeth had died in Australia).<br />
					- http://person.ancestry.com.au/tree/19934276/person/882378748/facts<br />
				There are various other possibilities related to an Elizabeth Baker born within 10 miles of Mayfield (where the marriage occurred) in a relevant time period<br />
					- Elizabeth Baker - c. 28/3/1803 Rotherfield (3.4 miles), f=Thomas, m=Lucy<br />
					- Elizabeth Baker - c. 3/8/1800 Frant (6.8 miles), f=Isaac, m=Hannah
				</p>
				<p>
				Note 2:<br />
				Records for the Kains list the convicts aboard (coincidentally including an Eliza Harris!) but not the free immigrants. There are various source of information (such as surgeons records but these do not mention the family). The link to this ship is however given in several sources. Various later records for Jonathan jnr (when he was convicted and sent to Tasmania) indicated he arrived aboard the Kains. And a diary by one of the seamen on the ship (Charles Picknell) mentions a free woman called Harris.
				</p>
				<p>
				Note 3:<br />
				All three children were baptised in Paramatta:<br />
				Sophia – b. 15/1/1832, bap. 26/2/1832, Parramatta (by Chas. Dickinson - from Field of Mars!)<br />
				Thomas – b. 13/7/1833, bap. 28/12/1833, Parramatta (by Rev. Robert Forrest)<br />
				George – b. 19/8/1835, bap. 9/12/1835, Parramatta (by H.H.Bobart)
