				</p>
				<p>
				John Moore was born to Joseph Moore and Phoebe Moore (nee Dunster) on 20th April 1816, and baptised on 28-4-1816 in Woodchurch, Kent, UK. His parents had married in 1812 in Woodchurch and he had an older sister Sarah, born in 1813. His mother Phoebe was born in Woodchuch and had grown up in a large pauper family [Note 1]. His father was baptised in nearby High Halden, but appears to have been living in Bethersden. When he was only a few months old family was the subject of a "removal order", out of Woodchurch and back to Bethersden.
				</p>
				<p>
				"<em>To Woodchurch and Bethersden ... Whereas complaint has been made upon us ... Justices of the Peace ... by Woodchurch that Joseph Moore Labourer with Phebe his wife and Sarah aged three years and a half and John aged nine months his children did lately come to inhabit in Woodchurch not having gained a legal settlement there … remove and convey Joseph Moore and his wife and children to Bethersden and them to deliver to the Churchwardens, together with this Order, who are required to receive and provide for them according to Law</em>". Woodchurch Parish Chest, P400/13/5, 04 July 1816, Removal Out of Woodchurch to Bethersden [Note 2].
				</p>
				<p>
				John's father, Joseph, died on 14-2-1819 in Halden, Kent [Note 3], when John was less than three years old. Two and half years later, on to 11-8-1821, his mother Phoebe remarried to Thomas Buckman, in Bethersden, Kent. Phoebe and Thomas then had a number of additional children - half-siblings to John. Whilst the 1841 UK census shows Sarah still living with her mother and step-father in Bethersden (indicating that John probably spent most of his childhood in Bethersden - possibly at a place called "Maylan Corner"), there is no further UK record for John.
				</p>
				<p>
				In 1838, at the age of 21, John emigrated from the UK, arriving aboard the ship James Pattison on 11-12-1838 [Note 4]. His immigration paperwork was certified by Richard Burnett, Vicar of Bethersden, supporting the view that he we was living with his mother and step-father in Bethersden. He is listed as Protestant, an agriculturalist, and able to read, but not write.
				</p>
				<p>
				He appears to have rapidly found his way to Goulburn, and been employed on the Faithfull brothers' property Springfield, south of Goulburn. His story is then well described in a story about his wife Margaret Considine (https://conversationswithgrandma.wordpress.com/2016/01/18/margaret-considine/):
				</p>
				<p>
				&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
				"<em>On the 25th of March 1838 a baptism was performed in St. Saviours Church, Goulburn, by Reverend William Sowerby of a child named Henry. The child’s mother was given as Margaret Concidine, (sic) singlewoman of Goulburn. … Evidently Margaret was working for the Faithfulls in Goulburn when she became pregnant and she continued to work for them after Henry’s birth. On the 3rd of September 1839, Margaret married the Faithfull’s dairyman, John Moore, in St Peters and Pauls Old Cathedral at Goulburn, with her sister and brother-in-law, Ellen and Christopher Cook as witnesses.[11] She was three months pregnant and it would be logical to presume John Moore to be the father but in a further twist, evidence suggests that one of the Faithfull brothers was also the father of this child.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
				<em>"Matilda Margaret Moore was born on the 9th of March 1840, and baptised in the Anglican faith as the child of John and Margaret Moore of Springfield. Springfield was the pioneering merino sheep station south of Goulburn established on land granted in 1828 to William Pitt Faithfull.[12] Curiously, a Matilda Faithfull began to appear as a witness at Faithfull weddings and baptisms in later years, including the marriage of Henry Faithfull, Margaret Considine’s first child. No record of any other Matilda Faithfull can be found so it seems likely that when representing the Moore side of the family Matilda used Moore as her surname and Faithfull when at Faithfull family events. An examination of these signatures supports this contention as the signatures of Matilda Faithfull and Matilda Moore are almost identical. Perhaps out of respect for the man who raised her, or for her mother, Matilda Moore seemed careful never to openly declare her father as a Faithfull, preferring instead to name John Moore as her father, including at her marriage to Frank Heach.[13]</em>
				</p>
				<p>
				<em>"To add further intrigue, neither Matilda nor Henry is named as a child of John or Margaret Moore on their death certificates even though both were still alive and Margaret and John’s oldest son, John jnr, registered the deaths.[14] This strongly suggests that he knew both Henry and Matilda were not children of the marriage between Margaret Considine and John Moore. Years later, in 1938 one of William Pitt Faithfull’s legitimate daughters, Constance Mary, died intestate in England. Henry and Alice Faithfull’s daughter Ada May Elliott lodged a claim against the estate and in an effort to prove Henry’s paternity an enquiry was made to the Registrar of the Bishop’s Registry, Diocese of Wangaratta. His reply amongst other matters stated in relation to Matilda Heach (nee Moore), “While I cannot state any facts about Mrs. Heach’s parentage, I can say quite definitely that I was informed by my late partner and always understood that she was an illegitimate daughter of George Faithfull..”[15]. This response suggests that the fact that John Moore was not Matilda’s biological father was known and widely accepted. This time, whichever Faithfull brother was Matilda’s father, he was not as generous towards Matilda as he was in the support of the clearly illegitimate Henry, possibly because John Moore had taken over the fathering role. If Matilda’s father was William Pitt Faithfull, less than four years after Matilda’s he had married and may have wished to play down that part of his life. George Faithfull never married and died in Wangaratta in 1855.[16]</em>
				</p>
				<p>
				<em>"One does wonder how John Moore got himself into this situation. Did he know of the pregnancy when he married Margaret? Did William Pitt Faithfull give him any incentives to marry Margaret? The tales that Margaret could tell of Goulburn and the exploits of the Faithfull brothers in particular can only be imagined. Margaret and John’s marriage nevertheless went on to be a long and happy one. They remained working for the Faithfulls at Goulburn where their first son, also John, was born in January 1843.[17] Sometime between July and November 1845 the couple moved to The Hollow Station at Hedi (later Edi), in Victoria, to manage the station for William Faithfull.[18] Around 1850 they moved on to Whorouly to manage a station for Dr. George Edward Mackay, J.P.[19] Later John bought a property on One Mile Creek at Wangaratta which they named Tenterfield, perhaps in some reference to the New South Wales town, although a connection there is yet to be found.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
				<em>"Margaret and John had five sons and two daughters together, however only one daughter survived infancy. Settling into family life, Margaret became known for “her kindness of heart and skill in the treatment of sickness”.[20] She saw all of her adult children marry except Thomas, the youngest. The girls in particular can be said to have ‘married well’. Matilda married Frank Heach, a wealthy butcher, hotelier and business entrepeneur while Harriet married Dr. Thomas Marum, although neither women had any children.[21] Two sons – John and William – married daughters of William Clark, the ‘Father of Wangaratta’, a large landowner and publican.[22]</em>
				</p>
				<p>
				<em>"Despite her husband’s Protestant faith, Margaret kept the Roman Catholic faith. When John died in 1891 he was buried in the Church of England section of Wangaratta cemetery and Margaret erected a fitting monument. However when Margaret succumbed to the effects of influenza in 1895 she was buried in the Roman Catholic section where she remained without a headstone until the 1950s.[23] This great loss to the history of both Goulburn and Wangaratta was echoed in her obituary. “.. the district loses one of the very earliest pioneers, and one whose kind and gentle nature has brought relief and comfort to many a sad and distressed family</em>”.
				</p>
				<p>
				&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
				As described, John married Margaret Considine in Goulburn on 3-9-1839, less than 9 months after arriving in the colony [Note 6]. Margaret already had one child, Henry, and a second, Matilda, was born three months after the wedding. Another child (the first definitively to John), also John, was born on 16-1-1843 at Springfield. Later that year the family (John and Margaret, with Henry, Matilda and John) moved to the Hollow Station at Hedi (later Edi), in Victoria, to manage the station for William Faithfull. William and George (twins, 23-11-1845) and probably Charles (25-8-1849) were born at Hollow Station. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Around 1850 the growing family moved on to Whorouly to manage a station for Dr. George Edward Mackay, where Harriet was born (16-8-1851). Later, John bought a property on One Mile Creek at Wangaratta (the above story indicates the property was called Tenterfield). Sarah (20-5-1854, died as infant) and Thomas (27-12-1857) were born here. The One Mile Creek property was 100 acres, and was the area that is now bounded by College St., Appin St., Phillipson St. and Williams Rd in Wangaratta.
				</p>
				<p>
				There are various subsequent newspaper mentions of John. On 3rd July 1860 at Boutherambo, he competed in the first annual ploughing match of the Ovens and Murray Agricultural and Horticultural Association. He competed as one of seven horse teams, though did not succeed in a placing. He is mentioned again in 1875 when his son George died. In 1876 he accepted nomination as a candidate for a council seat. In a newspaper advertisement he stated:
				</p>
				<p>
				"<em>To the Ratepayers of the Borough of Wangaratta.</em><br />
				<em>Ladies and Gentlemen, - Having been requested by a large number of my fellow ratepayers to allow myself to be nominated as a Candidate for a seat in your Council, I have, after mature deliberation, consented.</em><br />
				<em>If elected, my object shall always be the advancement of the town in which I have been resident for 33 years [Note 7], and in which my sole interest in staked. The judicious expenditure of the revenue I consider of primary importance, yet where the interests of the borough can be promoted at any time by exceeding the usual limits, I shall endeavor to act liberally though cautiously.</em><br />
				<em>It has been stated that I have come forward to serve party interests. I needly hardly say that such is not the case, and I feel certain that few if any will credit the assertion.</em><br />
				<em>Should you do me the honor of returning me, I shall endeavor faithfully to serve you to the utmost of my ability.</em><br />
				<em>I have the honor to be, Yours faithfully, John Moore.</em>"
				</p>
				<p>
				The result of the election was: Alexander Tone, 179 votes; Mark Whitty 131; John Johnson 115; John Moore 112; Michael Maloney 108; Andrew Jones 66. The first three were elected, which means John missed out by 3 votes.
				</p>
				<p>
				In 1878 a newspaper article reported an accident where John lost a finger:<br />
				"<em>Accident - We very much regret having to record, says the Wangaratta Dispatch, an accident which befel Mr John Moore, senr., of the Three Mile Creek on Friday last. While working a chaff-cutting machine, Mr Moore unthinkingly put his hand where the cutters descend, the consequence being that the second finger of one of his hands came in contact with the cutter, which nearly severed it from the second joint, leaving it hanging by the skin. Dr Hutchinson sewed it up, but it is very doubtful whether amputation will not yet have to be resorted to. Mr Moore is one of the oldest residents in this district, and is universally respected</em>".
				</p>
				<p>
				John died on 3-8-1891 at One Mile Creek at the age of 76. His death was reported by his son John jnr, and the certificate gives his cause of death as "pleurisy and congestion of lungs and colic". His parents are listed as "not known", and he is recorded as having been born in England, and having spent 5 years in NSW and then 48 years in Victoria. His is listed as having married at age 26 to Margaret Considine, and with children George (deceased), John (48), William (45), Charles (42), Harriet (36), and Thomas (33). He was buried on 5-8-1891 in Wangaratta Cemetery.
				</p>
				<p>
				John's probate documents list his executors as William Heach and John's two younger sons, John (occupation: carter) and William Moore (occupation: drover). His assets are listed as: 35 acres of land worth £350 (allotments 1,2,3,4,12,13 of section 6, Parish of Wangaratta - the area now bounded by Philipson St, Edwards St, Swan St and Turner St); crops, livestock, farming implements, furniture, etc. to the value of £146; and cash of £151. His will (written in January 1888) leaves this in trust to this wife, and then after her death the land is split between his five living children, except for £53 to his grandson George (son of his deceased son George).
				</p>
				<p>
				John's wife Margaret died of influenza in 1895. She was not buried with John in the Anglican section of the cemetery, but rather in the Catholic section of the cemetery.
				</p>
				<p>
				&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
				---
				</p>
				<p>
				Note 1:<br />
				There are records for the baptisms of siblings of Phoebe in Woodchurch: Elizabeth (1780), Mary (1784), Francis (1786), William (1788), George (1791), Phoebe (1793), James (1794). For the last three of these, the occupation is listed as "Paupers". There is however some uncertainly regarding the birth location of Phoebe, as a different record has her birth location as Womenwold, Kent (26 miles east of Woodchurch).
				</p>
				<p>
				Note 2:<br />
				The date of removal order is 4-7-1816, which would mean John was only 3 months old, and yet the order refers to him as being 9 months. There is no other record of a John Moore being born in Woodchurch around this time, and all the details otherwise match, so it is assumed that the mention of "9 months" is an error in the original documents or a transcription error.
				</p>
				<p>
				Note 3:<br />
				John was born in 1816 to Joseph and Phoebe. His mother Phoebe remarried in 1821 and is listed as a widow on the marriage. There is only one record of a Joseph Moore dying in Kent between 1816 and 1821 - in Halden on 14-2-1819.
				</p>
				<p>
				Note 4:<br />
				The date on the baptism record matches exactly the information on the immigration records, confirming the connection between the baptism record and the John Moore who arrived in Australia in 1838.
				</p>
				<p>
				Note 5:<br />
				The marriage record lists John as being from Co. Argyle (one of the nineteen NSW counties that encompassed Goulburn) and Margaret as being fom Goulburn.
				</p>
				<p>
				Note 6:<br />
				The story about Margaret Considine refers to the marriage occurring in "St Peters and Pauls Old Cathedral at Goulburn" - the Catholic cathedral - and includes reference to registry entry 7 (this is currently being sought but has not yet been obtained). A history of St Peters and Pauls however indicates that construction of the first catholic church in Goulburn was not commenced until 1844! 
				</p>
				<p>
				Note 7:<br />
				This is consistent with him arriving in the district in 1843.
