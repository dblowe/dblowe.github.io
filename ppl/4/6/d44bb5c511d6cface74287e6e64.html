				<strong></strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Story</strong></span><strong></strong>
				</p>
				<p>
				<em>There are a number of different people called John Maher and Margaret Maher in Victoria in the mid-1800’s, including numerous couples. The result is a significant lack of clarity regarding some of the critical records.  See the associated research document for the full detailed analysis.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
				John was born around 1813 to Pat Maher and Julia Darcey, possibly in Roscrea, Tipperary, Ireland. He married Margaret Whelan [Note 1], possibly on 30/8/1835 in Roscrea. Around 1836 they had their first child, Pat.
				</p>
				<p>
				John, Margaret and Pat (by then 6 years old) emigrated to Australia aboard the Marquis of Bute, departing from Greenock on 11/8/1841, and arriving in Port Philip on 30/11/1841, around 15 weeks later. The ship was quarantined on arrival due to a number of cases of typhoid fever on board [Note 2].
				</p>
				<p>
				Report: <em>Friday, December 3, 1841 The Port Phillip Herald: The Marquis of Bute had a very severe passage. She had a head wind the greater part of the way. There were 3 births and 8 deaths (principally children) 36 single females, 42 single males, so no bounty paid for 4, 41 adult males and 42 females with chn aged 7-15, 7m, 11f, aged 1-7, 19m, 12f, infants 6m, 7f, total 149 souls, total bounty 3277.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
				There were three additional single women also on the ship named Whelan: Biddy 18yo, Ellen 15yo, and Rachel 17yo, with the first two listed as coming from Roscrea, and Rachel listed as coming from Roscrea in one list and Belfast on another. Given that same surname and possible location, these may be related to Margaret. There is a matching baptism record for Biddy in Roscrea on 24/6/1823, with a father Malick? Whelan and a mother Mary? Lalor, so it is possible these are also Margaret’s parents, though a matching baptism record for Margaret has yet to be located.
				</p>
				<p>
				John, Margaret and Pat arrived in Port Philip only around 5 years after Port Philip was settled. The next child, John, was born in Collingwood only 4½ months after arriving in the colony.
				</p>
				<p>
				The family appears to have then moved to the Geelong area. Michael was born in Geelong in early 1843, just 9 months after John was born. Michael was baptised in the new (temporary) Catholic Church building that was inaugurated in Nov’1942 in Geelong, just two months earlier. There are newspaper records indicating they contributed funds to the church, and they are mentioned in the booklet “St Mary's Geelong : its founding community” by Bettina Blackall [Note 3].
				</p>
				<p>
				The couple then moved around and had further children: Martin in 1845 in Barrabool Hills (15km west of Geelong) and then Edward in 1846 in Mt Eliza (on the east shore of Port Philip). William was born in Melbourne in 1848 and Elizabeth in Fiery Creek in 1851. There is then a gap until the birth of Anne in Duck Ponds (now known as Lara – near Geelong) in 1857. The family is then likely to have moved to Bullarook, near Ballarat, as Mary appears to have been born in Bullarook around 1859. 
				</p>
				<p>
				On 4/11/1859 a Ballarat newspaper article described John Maher as being charged with threatening to take the life of his wife, Margaret. Their daughter Anne died as a 7 year old, and was buried on 15/4/1865 in Ballarat. John was granted 100 acres of land in Bullarook sometime between 1868 and 1872. Sometime during the 1860’s their son Michael also moved away to the area around Nagambie, and in 1868 married Bridget Roche. This move may have been acrimonious, as Michael was not mentioned on John’s death certificate 25 years later.
				</p>
				<p>
				It is also worth noting that there appears to be numerous other couples named John and Margaret Maher in Victoria during the period 1840 to 1880: John Maher and Margaret Ryan (living in Tatura), John Maher and Margaret Laffan/Latham (living in Tallarook/Seymour), John Maher and Margaret ?? (living in Merri Creek), John Maher and Margaret ?? (living in Richmond), John Maher and Margaret Sheehy, John Maher and Margaret Lalor, and finally John Maher + Margaret Cormick.
				</p>
				<p>
				John and Margaret’s son John died as a 37 year in 1880, and was buried in the same plot as Anne on 27/10/1880. John then died on 28/9/1893 in Eyre St, Ballarat. The death certificate lists him as 93 years old; a farmer; father is Pat Maher (blacksmith) and mother is Julia Darcey. He is listed as being born in Tipperary, Ireland, having spent 30  years in Victoria; and was married in Tipperary at the age of age 30, to Margaret Phelan .
				</p>
				<p>
				The death certificate also lists the following children: Patrick (55yo), John (dec.), Martin (48yo), Edward (dec.), William (44yo), Elizabeth (42yo), Mary (38yo). Neither Anne nor Michael are mentioned: Anne possibly because she died as a child, but no hint of why Michael is not included.
				</p>
				<p>
				John’s probate documents left his estate to his wife Margaret – but Margaret died just 2 weeks later on 11/10/1893. The estate was then left to his son Martin (who appears to have then managed the farm at Bullarook, until at least 1901, when there is an advertisement for the farm to be rented) and his daughter Mary Deedman.
				</p>
				<p>
				---
				</p>
				<p>
				Note 1:<br />
				The (possible) marriage certificate gives his name as John Meagher, rather than John Maher, though once he arrived in Australia his name was always written Maher. Also, it is also worth noting that the maiden name of Margaret Maher was somewhat confused, being shown as both Whelan and Phelan in various records. The death records in Ballarat clearly refer to her as Margaret Phelan, but the children on John’s death record match very closely the birth records of children with parents John Maher and Margaret Whelan. There is sufficient evidence to conclude that the Whelan and Phelan records refer to the same person (and, in Ireland, Whelan was often pronounced with an “F”).
				</p>
				<p>
				Note 2:<br />
				For stories of the trip on the Marquis of Bute, see http://harperfamilytree.com/andrew-and-maria-harper-bound-for-the-colonies/.  Note: the couple in this story lived in Geelong for a while, and the wife died in Bullarook at age 46, so they may have been connected with the Mahers.

				This book seems to incorrectly indicate they arrived aboard the Martin Luther in 1842. It is believed that this is a different couple named John and Margaret Maher (the existence of the 6yo Pat on the Marquis of Bute suggests this is the right couple).
				</p>
				<p>
				Note 4:<br />
				This could be a misreading for 50 years?  If this was correct then it would imply an arrival in the colony in 1863 with all the children – and no such record can be found. Alternatively it may relate to an assumption based on a possible arrival in Ballarat around 1863.
				</p>
				<p>
				Note 5:<br />
				His death certificate lists his age as 93, implying a date of birth of ~1800, and an age of 38 for the birth of his first child, and 55yo for his last. This year of birth contradicts the age of 28 shown on the 1841 immigration passenger list. Also, the marriage age of 30 implies a marriage year of around 1830, which is not consistent with the assumed marriage in 1835 or the reported age of 28 on the immigration record (when he was already married). This issue is still un-resolved.

			<h4>Narrative</h4>
			<div class="grampsstylednote">
				<p>
				<strong></strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Further research</strong></span><strong></strong>
				</p>
				<p>
				- Search for birth records of daughter Mary<br />
				- Continue to search Ireland records<br />
					- Possible: http://tipperarynorth.rootsireland.ie/search.php (requires subscription - 1 month = 25€)<br />
					- http://registers.nli.ie/parishes/0805
				</p>
				<p>
				- Explore what other types of records might exist for the Nagambie area, particularly to see if either John and Margaret spent time there with Michael, or if their son John spent time there.<br />
				- Obtain land records for selection and ownership of Tabilk land selections for son Michael.<br />
				- Obtain land records for selection and ownership of Bullarook land, and in particular whether this was originally selected by John (around 1870?), then passed to Martin (around 1893) and then passed onwards again.<br />
				- Explore possible records from the 1856 census<br />
				- Search for additional information on Michael’s brother Pat, and Pat’s son Michael – and particularly their time in Coolac/Gundagai (maybe check the death record for this Pat)?<br />
				- Obtain the death record for Anne Maher d. 1865 to check if it indicates Margaret Whelan or Phelan as the mother? And where this occurred?<br />
				- Obtain death certificate for Martin d. 1926 in Wagga<br />
				- Do a more detailed search for Michael’s brother John (particularly around the Nagambie area in the 1870’s).
