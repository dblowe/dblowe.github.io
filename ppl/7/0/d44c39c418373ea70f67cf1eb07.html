				<em>Connecting Context:</em><br />
				<em>Listed as father of Mona Weber in various sources</em>
				</p>
				<p>
				&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
				Guido Fritz Leopold Cyril Weber was born on 5th April 1879 in Clarendon, Windsor, NSW, to Carl Ludwig Adalbert Weber and Elizabeth Duke Rice. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Guido's father Carl was a surveyor. As a 19 year old he was working in the goldfield areas north of Bathurst (an 1872 Newspaper article gives a report he submitted) [Note 1]. By the mid-1870's he was in the Illawarra area working for James Manning [Note 2], and 1875 Carl married Elizabeth Rice. In 1876 Carl appears to have selected 2 acres in the Bathurst Gold Fields, but in early 1877 was back living in Sydney (Ultimo) when his first son Duke Weber died. He was then appointed a Roads Superintendent and moved to Clarendon (near Windsor) where he worked surveying areas such as the Colo River. Guido was then born in Clarendon in 1879. His birth certificate indicates that his parents were married 13th Jan 1875 at Appin, NSW, and had two previous children, one deceased (Duke) and one alive (Arnold). Guido's father is listed as a Road Superintendent, 25 years old, and born in Germany. His mother is listed as 23 years old and born Shoalhaven.
				</p>
				<p>
				By 1881 Carl had moved back to the Illawarra as a Roads Superintendent where, amongst other activities, he built "Weber's lookout" at Bulli Pass. The family remained in the Illawarra until they moved to Glenn Innes in early 1884, but by mid-1886 (by which time Guido was 7 years old) the family was back in the Illawarra again where they then remained.
				</p>
				<p>
				An 1893 Newspaper article lists Guido, now 14 years old, passing musical examinations (along with his brother Arnold and his aunt Mysie Rice). Then in December 1897 the Govt Gazette indicates he was "entitled to present [himself] as [a candidate] at the Competitive Examination of applicants for admission to the Public Service". Presumably he was unsuccessful as he reapplied in 1899, this time successfully (the Public Service Lists gives his date of appointment as 18/4/1899, so just after turning 20 years old).
				</p>
				<p>
				Guido's teacher's record indicate that he was "employed as teacher on probation at Bullongong" (this is near Captain's Flat, around 60km SW of Canberra) from 19th April 1899, being on a salary of £72 per annum. He remained at Bullongong for 6 months and was then moved to Hawthorne Provisional School, in Hawthorne Parish, Arrawatta - around 10km south of the Queensland border, north of Inverell.
				</p>
				<p>
				During the 16 months Guido spent at Hawthorne (Oct'99 to Feb'01) he must have met his future wife, Eleanor Talbot, who was at the time a teacher at Glenlyon (May'99 to May'02), 80km north in Qld.  On 13th Feb 1901 Guido was moved to Marrickville Public School in Sydney, and then 5 months later at the end of July he was the teacher at new school opened at "St Heliers, Sandy Creek" (near Muswellbrook), now on a salary of £88 per annum.
				</p>
				<p>
				Guido must have remained in contact with Eleanor Talbot, as the following year, on 9th July 1902 he married Eleanor Talbot. The marriage certificate indicates the marriage occurred in Wollongong (at St Michaels Church of England), and both Guido (aged 23) and Eleanor (aged 25) were school teachers, with Eleanor originally coming from Mackay in Queensland. Shortly after the marriage in 1902 Guido and Eleanor moved to Copeland, with Guido teaching at Copeland North Public School (10km west of Gloucester) - with his salary increasing to £120 per annum by 1904.
				</p>
				<p>
				Guido's and Eleanor remained in Copeland for between 4 and 8 years, becoming part of the local community (Guido became the president of the Copeland School of Arts for 1905 and 1906). Their first two children were born in Copeland - Mona (1903) and Eric (1906). Their third child, Elizabeth (1908), was born in Wollongong - though this might have been during a move. At some point between 1906 and 1910, Guido and Eleanor moved to Lostock, a small town near Dungog.
				</p>
				<p>
				Eleanor then died in childbirth on 4/4/1911. Eleven months later, on 1/3/1912, Guido remarried - to Eleanor's younger sister Caroline (now aged 32). The marriage occurred in Balmain, Sydney, and Caroline is listed as a nurse living in Mackay, Queensland, and Guido is listed as living at Speers Point, Boolaroo (south of Newcastle).
				</p>
				<p>
				By the following year, 1913, Guido, Caroline and their three children (aged 5-10) had moved to Dubbo, with Guido teaching at Delroy Public School. The family then remain in Dubbo until the start of WWI, with another child, Joyce, being born in 1916. On 1st July 1916, at the age of 37, Guido enlisted at Dubbo (with his brother Arnold taking over the teaching). His enlistment formed indicated he served with the "Light Horse (Hunter River Lancers)" for 2 years. In October 1916 the family moved back to Wollongong (South Coast Rd, Garden Hill) and Guido moved to Liverpool.
				</p>
				<p>
				On 8/11/1916 Guido embarked at Sydney aboard "S.S.Port Nicholson" as part of the 22 reinforcements, 2nd Batt.  He disembarked Devonport on 10/1/1917. In England he was temporarily promoted to Acting Cpl on 8/2/17 on Permanent Cadre of 1st Tng Btn (Training Battalion). He was then promoted to temporary E.R.Cpl on 1/7/17.
				</p>
				<p>
				On 25/9/1917 he reverted to private and proceeded overseas to France. He was wounded in action on 7/11/1917. His service records indicate: "Buried by shell explosion 7-11-17 - Ypres. Some tremor of hands, legs, &amp; tongue. Left pupil dilated. Arm jerks present" and "Slight wound left heel at Passchendaele 7/11/17 - he was blown up and buried with four others - dug out. He was in an outpost at the time. He carried on alright after being dug out - until about 12 hours later. When coming back to supports he 'collapsed'. Seemed to lose all control of his limbs."

				He was transferred to England and then departed England aboard "Euripedes" on 30/1/1918, arriving back in Melbourne, Australia on 21/3/1918, before being discharged on 26/4/1918. He was awarded the 1914/15 Star, the British War Medal, and the Victory Medal.
				</p>

				A Dubbo newspaper article, from 29th March 1918, stated: "Private Guido Weber, of Delroy, who entered camp on the 1st July 1916, and some 10 months at the front, a period of 18 months active service being covered altogether from the moment he left Australia, returned to Dubbo on Wednesday morning. He saw service at Zonnebeke, Polygon Wood, Chateau Segar, Passchendaele, etc. At the latter place he was wounded by a high explosive shell, at which time he lay out in No Man's land for a period of 48 hours. Lying there suffering, every moment seeming an hour in length, he had time to catch occasional glimpses of the battalion stretcher-bearers. ... He was buried for about a quarter of an hour after the explosion. Picked up by an old comrade and put in a place of safety, whence he was removed to Ypres."
				</p>
				<p>
				In 1919 Guido was appointed as a teacher at Wollongong District School, and then in 1920 he was appointed to become a teacher in Newcastle, where he remained for several years. In 1920 Guido and Caroline also had their second and last child, Ruth. During this time Guido's oldest daughter Mona also completed school and became a teacher in Newcastle (where she remained for the rest of her life, after marrying George Preston in 1925). In 1923 Guido and Caroline, and their younger children moved back south again, and Guido became headmaster at Tomerong School near Nowra.
				</p>
				<p>
				In the early 1930's Guido and Caroline bought land in Currarong and built their home ("the Shelter' in Piscator Street). Initially he remained in Nowra, and then for a while Sylvania, but eventually moved to Currarong where he remained for most of the rest of his life. Guido continued to be actively involved in his local community - being involved in the setting up of the Bush Fire Brigade and the Progress Association and also served as a Park Ranger. He also maintained oyster leases on the rocks on the southern side of the bridge.
				</p>
				<p>
				Guido died in Ronoli Private Hospital, Wollongong on 25th November 1954, at the age of 75 years. He died of myocardial infarction, hypertensive heart disease, and chronic bronchitis. At the time he was living at 139 Towradgi Rd, Corrimal. He was cremated on 26th November at Woronora Crematorium.

				The following story from Daphne Salt tells Guido's story, though aspects of this may be apocryphal (these are shown with a {?} symbol) [Note 3].
				</p>

				----START QUOTE---

				<p>
				Carl and Elizabeth raised seven children, their second son being Guido Fritz Leopold Cyril born 5/4/1879. Guido married twice, first in 1902 to Eleanor who bore him three children, Eric, Bessie and Mona, before her death in childbirth. Guido then married Frances Caroline Talbot at Balmain on 1/3/1912 and raised two more girls, Joyce and Ruth [mother of the author of this article].
				</p>
				<p>
				Together with his father Carl, then the NSW Road Superintendent {?}, Guido surveyed the Bulli, Mt Kiera, and Macquarie Passes and the Sydney to Newcastle and Sydney to Wollongong railways {?}. [Their notes and records are in the NSW State Archives].
				</p>
				<p>
				In addition to qualifications {?} as a surveyor, engineer and school teacher, Guido was also a skilled artist and created his own colour wheel years before the colour wheel was publicly used {?}. In his little school near Newcastle before the First World War, Guido had a young student named Bill {?}. Bill was not interested in his lessons, he had very little mathematical and grammatical aptitude, but he had a flair for lines and design. Recognising this in his hapless pupil, Guido took him aside and taught him the skills of the brush. Young Bill went on to become Sir William Dobell. My mother's sisters also taught young Willie - down by a creek in the schoolyard, they taught him to swallow tadpoles - "they wiggle their tails and slide down like velvet" the giggling girls convinced him as he dropped one in his mouth!
				</p>
				<p>
				Although German born Carl L.A. Weber was only two years old when he came to Australia, and was 60 years old when World War One broke out he was classified as an alien despite having lived all his life here. The government decreed that all aliens were to be interned for the duration of the War unless they or a member of their family fought as an Australian soldier.
				</p>
				<p>
				Guido felt that it was his patriotic duty to fight for king and country and also by signing up he kept his aged father out of the camps. He left his teaching post to serve with the Intelligence Branch {?} of the AIF and supervising anti-gas measures in the front lines of the Great War.
				</p>
				<p>
				Guido received a signed accolade from Queen Mary, written in her own hand {?} from Windsor Castle for his valiant war efforts.
				</p>
				<p>
				Many of the boys who fought in the War to end all Wars returned home with injuries as a legacy of their allegiance. Guido had sustained head, spinal and other injuries when he was wounded by shrapnel and buried in the mud at Passchendale in France in 1917 {?}. After he was shipped home he was a patient at Randwick Hospital intermittently over many years. It was from there in Hut 11 that the idea of the TPI in NSW began. Guido advertised for other wounded soldiers to contact them and convened a meeting {?} - thus began the TPI in NSW. The inaugural meeting was held on 23rd July 1934 with a foundation membership of 10. Their one and only table had but three legs, two of which were shaky, a box supplying the fourth. Of chairs, all were cripples. " . .. all were very sick men who could never have met save perchance, in hospital. No two came from the same unit.... Outside bodies looked ' askance' at our Organization, and either politely declined or ignored our humble requests ..... Through days of poverty and strife the stalwarts stuck to their guns, failure in one direction, and another avenue was sought, made or found, and now stands a body worthy of Public Approval and Support!"
				</p>
				<p>
				During the Depression years the members of the emergent TPI were very active. Guido, as its Secretary managed to organize taxis and other transport for incapacitated men to attend the Dawn Services on ANZAC Days. He stirred the cause for the shattered men; and he fought for free medical attention for them. Guido and his TPI executive knocked on the doors of the retailers and managed to secure discounts for them and their families, Angus and Robertson and the Sydney City Council gave them books to begin their library.
				</p>
				<p>
				Settled home again after the war, Guido built a rotary clothes line out of timber and invited an AIF compatriot, a Mr Hill, home for refreshments one day. Mr Hill was extremely impressed by Guido's creation {?} and when he went back to Adelaide he made one out of water pipe and took out a patent for his Hills Hoist.
				</p>
				<p>
				Guido was a public spirited man who began and was an office bearer or member of many community orientated groups. Apart from the TPI, he was a foundation member and treasurer of the Sylvania branch of the RS &amp; SILA [RSL], a member of the Guard of Honour for the Prince of Wales Royal Visit in 1920, he was a Justice of the Peace and one of the first Australian members of the Royal Overseas League, his membership card being dated 13.2.1914 and signed by its' founder Sir Evelyn Wrench. In 1936 Guido secured the starting point for the 150th Anniversary Parade in the Sutherland Shire to be Sylvania.
				</p>
				<p>
				Guido and Frances Caroline bought land in Currarong in the early 1930s and built their own home "the Shelter' in Piscator Street. Frances was a nurse and in the isolation of Currarong was often called to attend illness and mishaps of Currarong residents. While living in Currarong Guido was instrumental in setting up the Bush Fire Brigade and the Progress Association and also served as a Park Ranger to protect the fauna and flora in the region. He was a fisheries inspector {?} and had oyster leases on the rocks on the southern side of the bridge. Guido kept bees and produced his own honey. He had an extensive vegetable garden and an impressive 'fernery' for exotic and native plants and flowers.
				</p>
				<p>
				For the benefit of visitors to the paradise of Currarong Guido constructed and painted a very large locality map on tin, which was sited beside the shop and stood the test of decades of time.
				</p>
				<p>
				In 1934, Guido put to Mr Henry Halloran a proposal to erect a summer house or rotunda in the park for protection from the elements for the use and enjoyment of the Currarong residents and visitors. Because of the accessibility of the reserve to the main village, street, shop, river and beach, Mr Halloran was very keen to comply with the request and asked Guido to draw up the plans for it. This original document has been donated to Currarong by Guido's granddaughter.
				</p>
				<p>
				Guido was instrumental in acquiring some National Parks {?} including the Beecroft Peninsula Reserve - see Shoalhaven News 31/1/045] Guido loved Currarong and perceived its significance in its geological resemblance to the Kurnell Peninsula, where James Cook first set foot on Australian soil. Prior to his settling at Currarong, Guido with Mr. Myles J. Dunphy, honorary secretary of National Parks and Primitive Areas Council, spent many idealic vacations in the region. Guido was the instigator and originator of the proposal to set aside 8000 acres for reservation as a national park [Beecroft Peninsula Reserve], where thousands can wander its beaches, rocks, plains and slopes, where fishermen can try their skill, where bathing could be enjoyed by all ages, where naturalists, geologists or leisure seekers can enjoy the tranquillity of primitive nature.
				</p>
				<p>
				One of Guido's greatest pleasures was to join the nocturnal fishing ventures of his next door neighbour and close friend, Bill Ranger, one of Currarong's professional fishermen. Bill and Guido had helped to rescue the survivors of the wreck of the Merimbula which is so admirably covered in Max and Robyn Uren's "A Little History of Currarong" published by the Currarong Progress Association in July 2002. Bill Ranger's boat resembled a clinker surf boat; actually it was one of the life boats from the Merimbula which he converted for his fishing purposes by installing a 'putt-putt' motor in it. It was a big one cylinder thing that was started by winding a leather belt around a 14" -18" flywheel flicking the flywheel around with the belt. He had a large rudder and tiller at the back and an emergency sail in case there was a problem with the motor at sea. Pop Ranger used the Rock Pool as his docking facilities to land his catch and he moored it in the creek. Bill's house/tin shack is still standing in pretty good condition and it appears virtually unchanged since it was built. It is still green.
				</p>
				<p>
				Guido lived in his Beloved Currarong until his death in 1954.

				There are elements of this story that seem at odds with recorded history. For example, I have been unable to find any record that indicates William Dobell lived at Lostock, where Guido was teaching at the time. The comments on Prince George are also clearly in error, as Carl was 2 years old when he arrived in Australia.
