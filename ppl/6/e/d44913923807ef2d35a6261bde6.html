				<p>
				<strong></strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Story</strong></span><strong></strong>
				</p>
				<p>
				<em>Connecting Context: John Charles Lowe, was born in Victoria in 1862 to Charles Lowe and Bridget Dundon. The 1858 marriage certificate for Charles M. Lowe and Bridget Dundon lists Charles as 26 years old, his parents as Thomas Lowe and Helen Miller, and his birth location as Perthshire. A search of Perthshire finds only one relevant birth record as a starting point.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
				Charles Miller Low [Note 1]  was born in Redgorton [Note 2], Perthshire, Scotland on 10th Dec 1829 to Thomas Low and Helen Miller, and baptised on 20th December 1829. He had older siblings William (1824), Maria (1826), and Margaret (1828), and younger siblings Peter (1832, died), Helen (1834), and Peter (1837).
				</p>
				<p>
				The 1841 census shows him living at Downhill, in the Parish of Redgorton, as an 11 year old, with his parents, 5 siblings, and three others. His father (Thomas, 50yo) is listed as an Innkeeper and his mother seems much younger (35yo). The same address also lists a separate household of Alexander (25yo, Blacksmith apprentice) and Margaret (25yo) Low – possibly a half-brother from an earlier marriage?
				</p>
				<p>
				The house where he was living in 1841 is still standing [Note 3], is a Category C listed building [Note 4], and has recently been for sale [Note 5]. Information from an online discussion forum states:
				</p>
				<p>
				<em>"What i can tell you Downhill was originally named Dome-hill regarding the hill behind the houses and as village rumour goes it was once the site of an ancient settlement, when they were building up the banks for the railway seemingly a skeleton was found which they think dated 100s of years old, the local vicar was informed who ordered the bones to be put back into the soil.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
				<em>"Round the corner from Downhill (through the Bridges) you had the old Ordie shuttle mill that made the thread shuttles for the surrounding textile mills, this dated back to the 1800s.The big white house as we called it at Downhill was once the local shop (i dont have the dates handy just now but could soon find out) footnote to say that house has been on the property market for about 5 years, only pic i can find attached.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
				<em>"Im not too clear about the Inn just now though, the big white house would fit that profile though, size, shape, its place beside the road, next to stable blocks etc would certainly fit that profile. … The white house dates back to 1650s,my uncles house and converted stables is to the far left of the picture out of view". </em> [Note 6]
				</p>
				<p>
				&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
				A subsequent 1857 record for Downhill [Note 7] describes it as:
				</p>
				<p>
				"<em>Downhill: A neat dwellinghouse, and suitable offices, the former two storeys the latter one, all slated and in good repair also a smithy and dwelling property and residence of Mr Thomas Law, (Ordnance Survey Name Books, OS1/25/71/28)"</em>
				</p>
				<p>
				&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
				A newspaper article from 20th July 1849 refers to a Charles Low from Downhill being involved in a footrace, indicating he was still living in Downhill at this time:
				</p>
				<p>
				<em>"PERTH: “...Foot Race—lst, Donald M'Farlitio, Taymount, 2nd Charles Low, Downhill. ... ”, </em>Friday 20 July 1849, Dundee, Perth, and Cupar Advertiser, Angus, Scotland <em></em>
				</p>
				<p>
				&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
				In the 1851 census, Charles’ father (now 60yo) appears to have re-married to a younger wife, Christina, 39yo (this would imply that Charles’ mother Helen has died, which might explain Charles immigration?) and the only child living at home with Thomas and Christina is 13yo Peter. His older brother William is married to Jessie Young with 2 children and is living 8 miles north at Caputh. His older sister Maria is married to Peter Macintosh with 2 children and living in Downhill. His older sister Margaret is married to John Duff with three children and may already have emigrated to the U.S. 
				</p>
				<p>
				No 1851 census record for either 16yo Helen or 21yo Charles has been found.
				</p>
				<p>
				A newspaper article from 1853 suggests that Charles’ father is still at Downhill:
				</p>
				<p>
				“<em>... Tradesman this would most eligible opening. Farther particulars to terms, 4c. will be learned by applying to Mr. Low, at Downhill. ... </em>”, Thursday 03 November 1853, Perthshire Advertiser
				</p>
				<p>
				Though articles in 1854 and 1855 suggest he may have moved.
				</p>
				<p>
				“<em>... public that now occupies the Smithy lately possessed by Mr. Thomas Lowe. Downhill, and will give most punctual attention to the orders ... </em>”, Thursday 05 January 1854, Perthshire Advertiser
				</p>
				<p>
				“<em>...LET, at Downhill, a SMITH'S SHOP, with House and Garden; also, Self-Contained DWELLING-HOUSE, and Garden. Possession at ... </em>”, Thursday 03 April 1856, Perthshire Advertiser
				</p>
				<p>
				&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
				Charles must have emigrated to Australia between July 1849 (when he was mentioned in the newspaper as living at Downhill) and July 1858 (when he was married in Beechworth). No definitive immigration record can be found, but the most likely record is:
				</p>
				<p>
				-	Chas Low, 20yo, unassisted arr. Port Philip 11/1852 aboard Thorwaldsen<br />
					Possibly too young, but could just be rounding. He is shown as a “Metal Worker” which would be consistent with his family being blacksmiths.
				</p>
				<p>
				Other unlikely records include:
				</p>
				<p>
				-	Charles Lowe, 19yo, arr. Port Philip Bay 12/1854 aboard Aberfoyle<br />
					A number of Ancestry trees list this one, but it is unlikely. There are a number of different Lowe’s on the boat, listed as English, and occupation is “Gentleman”.
				</p>
				<p>
				-	Charles Law, 28yo, arr. Port Philip Bay 17/10/1857 aboard Blackwall<br />
					This is a little late for him to arrive, given the marriage in July 1858. He is also listed as “Foreign” and not “Scotch” so unlikely 
				</p>
				<p>
				-	Mr Low, arr. Port Philip 4/12/1855 aboard Red Jacket<br />
					Listed as a cabin passenger, so unlikely
				</p>
				<p>
				-	Mr C Low, arr. Port Jackson 3/9/1852, aboard Sir Bevois<br />
				-	Mr Low, arr.	Port Jackson 30/8/1853, aboard Hellespont --&gt; Lists both Mr &amp; Mrs Low (cabins)<br />
				-	Lowe, arr. Port Jackson 23/9/1853, aboard Gipsy Queen<br />
				-	Mr Low, arr. Port Jackson 4/10/1853, aboard Star of the East  --&gt; Cabin passenger<br />
				-	Mr Low, arr. Sydney 2/4/1854 aboard Mountain Maid  --&gt; From Wellingtom<br />
				-	Lowe, arr. Sydney 6/12/1854, aboard Hellespont  --&gt; Saloon passenger
				</p>
				<p>
				No other record of Charles can be found until his marriage to Bridget Dundon on 6th July 1858 in Beechworth. Bridget had arrived in 1855 as an 18yo.
				</p>
				<p>
				They were married in the Empire Hotel (which still exists) by John Grant, according to the Presbyterian rite. Charles listed his occupation as a miner, and both Charles and Bridget are described as normally residing in Reid’s creek (about 9km north of Beechworth, and the site of the original gold find in 1852).
				</p>
				<p>
				Almost immediately after the wedding a series of advertisements appeared in the Ovens and Murray Advertiser:
				</p>
				<p>
				<em>"Mrs Charles Lowe, - formerly Miss Bridget Dundon. – Please write to your Father and Sisters, who have arrived and are now in the Depot, Melbourne". </em>[Note 8]
				</p>
				<p>
				In the year following their wedding, as reported in several newspaper articles, both Charles and Bridget were witnesses in a murder trial, as the defendant had visited them on the morning following the murder. Charles is described as residing at Black Dog, and being a blacksmith, and in one of the articles is referred to as Charles <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Low</span>.
				</p>
				<p>
				Over the ensuing years, Charles and Bridget had the following children:
				</p>
				<p>
				-	Mary Ann, b. 1858.  No birth record can be found, but the death record indicates a likely birth year of 1858, which could put the date of birth less than 9 months after the marriage (which might explain why there is no birth record)!<br />
				-	John Charles, b. 1862, Lime (near Chiltern)<br />
				-	Ellen Miller, b. 1864, Estcourt (8km north of Wangaratta)<br />
				-	Lilian Margaret, b. 1868, Wangaratta<br />
				-	Thomas Edward, b. 1871; d. 1907, Yarrawonga<br />
				-	Rosina, b. 1872, Benalla<br />
				-	Lucy, b. 1875, Benalla<br />
				-	Charles Miller, b. 1877, Benalla; d. 1927
				</p>
				<p>
				Charles and Bridget’s son John wrote a diary that describes the family’s movements from the time he was born in 1861. At this time the family was living at Black Dog Creek, near Chiltern. A year later the family moved to Docker's Plains / Estcourt where, on 2/3/1863, Charles selected 65.53ha of land at Boorhaman, 20km north of Wangaratta [Note 9]. Charles then sold the land and moved to Wangaratta sometime between 1865 and 1868.
				</p>
				<p>
				A newspaper record from July 1866 lists Charles as the defendant in a court case brought by Anton Stack, for the sale of “Eight Thousand Bricks (more or less)”. In August 1866 another newspaper reports Charles unsuccessfully running in a council election, for the North Ovens Road District. He ran 5th out of 6 candidates.
				</p>
				<p>
				Two years later, in July 1868, Charles (still listed as being from Estcourt) was back in the Wangaratta Police Court, this time being convicted and fined £6, for selling spirits without a licence.
				</p>
				<p>
				Around 1872 the family moved to Benalla where they remained for around a decade. Bridget’s father John Dundon was also living with the family during this time, prior to his death in 1878. The probate record for John Dundon indicates that the family was living in Arundel Street, that Bridget was his eldest daughter [Note 10], there was only one other living child (Annie) and that Charles was working as a carpenter.
				</p>
				<p>
				In 1881 Charles moved to Jingellic to work in a tin mine, and shortly after this Bridget and the younger children followed (John and the two older sisters remained in Benalla). At some point prior to 1884 Charles and Bridget moved to Wagga Wagga.
				</p>
				<p>
				On 9/2/1884 a newspaper reported Bridget Lowe unsuccessfully applying for a court order “prohibiting publicans from supplying [Charles] with liquor”. She indicated that she had three children at home (presumably Rosina, Lucy and Charles Jnr), that her husband was regularly drunk, and that he “was wasting his means, leaving his family destitute, and impairing his own health”. On 13/12/1884 they were back in court, but in this case the parties did not appear (and presumably the case was therefore dismissed).
				</p>
				<p>
				On 7/1/1885, Charles was charged with having assaulted his married daughter, Mary Ann Chicken. The article reports that Charles came home one evening and try to collect his things to leave so he could “live separately”. His wife Bridget and daughter Mary Ann attempted to stop him and he assaulted them. The court case refers to “a general family quarrel between the parties”. The case was dismissed.
				</p>
				<p>
				Charles and Bridget eventually moved back south to Yarrawonga and lived with his son John. An article in the Yarrawonga Chronicle [Note 11] stated: 
				</p>
				<p>
				"<em>About the same time [mid 1880’s] there came another family, bearing the name of Lowe. Passing through to hunt kangaroos on ‘Nowranie’ in 1878, John C. Lowe liked the place and returned, later bringing his father, mother, two brothers, and two sisters (one of who is Mrs Ted Crilly). His brothers, Charles and Tom, were expert horse drovers and drove coaches into Riverina, but both were also carpenters and worked at their trade for many years"</em>.
				</p>
				<p>
				Presumably, at this stage, of Charles and Bridget’s 8 children, Mary Anne remained in Wagga with her husband, 5 of the children (definitely John, Tom, Charles, and Rosina [Note 12], and probably Lucy given that she would only have been ~10yo at this point [Note 13]) were in Yarrawonga, and two of the daughters (probably 21yo Ellen and 17yo Lillian [Note 14]) were elsewhere.
				</p>
				<p>
				The Yarrawonga Chronicle article indicates that Bridget did originally move to Yarrawonga in the mid 1880’s, but she is then absent from the 1903 electoral roll for Yarrawonga, which lists Charles living in Yarrawonga, along with his son John and John’s wife Margaret (who, in 1903, were married with 7 children aged 1yo-14yo), his son Thomas (who was married with 3 children, though it is possible his wife had died), and his son Charles Jnr (who may have been unmarried).
				</p>
				<p>
				Charles then died in Yarrawonga on 24th April 1906 at the age of 76. No probate records have been able to be located.
				</p>
				<p>
				The only subsequent record for Bridget is her death in 1922 in Sydney. Bridget appears to have moved to Sydney with her sister Ann Lampitt (and maybe her daughter Mary Ane Chicken, as Mary Ann possibly died in Sydney). Bridget died on 18th Feb 1822 in Sydney, and was buried at Rookwood cemetery on 20th Feb 1822. Her sister Ann died two and half years later and was buried in the same plot as Bridget on 20th August 1824.
				</p>
				<p>
				---
				</p>
				<p>
				Note 1:<br />
				The family appears to have been “Low” rather than “Lowe”. The change in spelling is likely to have happened on or after his arrival in Australia, given that “Lowe” was the more typical English spelling.<br />
				Also, there is some comfusiion over the spelling of Miller, with some records (including his marriage certificate) listing it as "Millar". Tracing back to Charles’ origins, his birth record lists his mother as Helen Miller. The 1841 census records for the same area around Redgorton show numerous Miller families, but no Millar families. And finally Charles death record list his name as Charles Miller Lowe. I suspect the Millar spelling on the marriage record was either just a misspelling or due to Charles poor literacy – but does explain the confusion.
