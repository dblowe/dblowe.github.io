				<p>
				Connecting Context:<br />
				<em>Will of Catherine Preston refers to her son George Arthur Preston being an executor. George's obituary refers to his mother Kathleen Preston, his birth record lists his mother as Kate, and his army enlistment record list his next of kin as his mother Katherine Preston. Oral family history gives her maiden name as Cooley.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
				Catherine (Kate) Cooley was likely born around Borrisokane (maybe in a place called Commons of Carney) in Co. Tipperary, Ireland around 1864 [Note 1,2]. Her death record lists her parents as John and Maria Cooley , though no record of birth has yet been able to be found [Note 3]. Her religion is unclear, though possibly she was Anglican / Church of Ireland [note 4].
				</p>
				<p>
				On 10/6/1882 Kates' cousin Margaret (who had arrived in Sydney aboard the Clyde on 14/5/1880, aged 25, along with her brother Michael aged 21) paid £5 each to sponsor the immigration of Kate Colley (aged 17) and Mary Gaynon (aged 18). They are both listed as domestic servants, and contact details are given as Milford and Commons of Carney, Borrisokane, Co. Tipperary [Note 5].
				</p>
				<p>
				Eight months later, on 7/2/1883 Kate and Mary arrived in Sydney aboard the Duchess of Argyle (surprisingly, Kate is listed as aged 21 and Mary as 25 - though these would seem to be incorrect approximations). Both are listed as cooks. Kate's father is listed as still alive in Tipperary, as are both Mary's mother and Father. Both are described as being able to read and write, and whilst Kate is CoEng, Mary is RC. Kate is listed as having a relation in the colony, Maggi Gaynon, Maitland.  Mary is listed as having a brother and sister in the colony, Margaret and Michael Gaynon, West Maitland.
				</p>
				<p>
				The following year Kate appeared to be living in West Maitland, as there is a record on 28/1/1884 of her depositing £4 to sponsor the immigration of Denis Gaynon, aged 20, groom, from Davrinwohill (Derrinvohil?), Borrisokane, Co. Tipperarry. The funds were refunded in Oct 1885 due to non-arrival.
				</p>
				<p>
				At some point around 1884 Kate married Frederick Preston, an agricultural laborer from Yorkshire. Frederick arrived in Sydney aboard the S.S.Abergeldie on 3rd Feb 1884, with no relatives in the colony.  Kate's obituary indicates she was married in Sydney at the age of 18, though no record of the marriage has yet been located [Note 6]. Kate and Frederick then moved to Newcastle, where they remained for the rest of their lives.
				</p>
				<p>
				Over the next 20 years Kate and Frederick had at least 10 children (from birth records), with 3 dying as children, 1 being killed in WW1, and 6 marrying. The first child, Margaret Anne, was born in 1885 and the last, Melita Eileen, was born in 1905 when Kate was around 41 years old. In 1887 their second child, William, died as an 8 month old when he drowned in a tub of water whilst Kate was nearby.
				</p>
				<p>
				Frederick died in 1913 when Kate was only 49 years old. Two of Kate's sons, George and Frederick, fought on the Western Front during WWI, with Frederick dying at Ypres and George being injured. Kate outlived her husband by 25 years, dying on 8th January 1939, at the age of 74. Her death certificate gives her parents as John and Maria. An obituary in the Catholic Press stated:
				</p>
				<p>
				"<em>The death occured on the 8th inst., of an old and respected resident of St. Mary's Star of the Sea parish, Newcastle, Mrs. Catherine Preston, at the age of 74 years. Mrs. Preston, who came from Ireland, was married in Sydney when 18 years of age, and soon afterwards settled in the east end of Newcastle, where she lived until her death. Her husband died in 1913. Two of her sons served in the Great War, and one of them, Frederick, was killed. She is survived by three sons, George, Jack and Howard, and three daughters, Mesdames Hornby (Cook's Hill), Frew (Islington) and Barnes (Cook's Hill). There are 23 grandchildren living and one great-grand-child. The three sons are well known in life-saving circles. One of them, Jack, is a life-member of the Newcastle Surf Club. A Requiem Mass was celebrated at St. Mary's Star of the Sea for the repose of deceased's soul. The funeral, which left her late home, was largely attended by members of the H.A.C.B. Society, Surf Club, Tattersall's Club and general public. Four grandsons were the pall-bearers, and flags on Newcastle Surf Club's buildings were flown at half-mast. — R.I.P.</em>"

				<p>
				Note 1:<br />
				Kate's origin location is suggested from several sources. Her obituary indicates that she "came from Ireland". The immigration inspection record indicates that she came from Tipperary. The deposit journal entry where her cousin Margaret sponsored her immigration lists her contact details as "Commons of Carney, Borrisokane, Co. Tipperary", though this may be where she was currently employed rather than where she was born. In 1884, after arriving in Sydney, she sponsored a cousin Denis Gaynon, who is listed as living as "Derrinvohil, Borrisokane". For information on Borrisokane see:<br />
				https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borrisokane<br />
				http://www.irelandgenweb.com/irltip/townlands/Borrisokane.htm
				</p>
				<p>
				Note 2:<br />
				Kate's year of birth is also unclear. Her obituary in January 1939 gives her age as 74 (so b. ~1864) and that she was 18 when married (likely in 1884, so b. ~1865). The deposit journal record in June 1882 gives her age as 17 (so b. ~1864/5). Her immigration in Feb 1883 gives her age as 21 (so b. ~1862) - though this seems the record most likely to be incorrect.
				</p>
				<p>
				Note 3:<br />
				R.C. birth record for Borrisokane are available for the period of Kate's likely birth, but Church of Ireland records are only available after 1877, so this may explain the absence.
				</p>
				<p>
				Note 4:<br />
				Kate's immigration records list her as Church of England. Interestingly her cousins Margaret and Mary Gaynon are listed on their immigration records as R.C., so there may have been a cross-faith marriage in the previous generation?
				</p>
				<p>
				Note 5:<br />
				No definitive record can be found for Margaret, Michael, and Mary Gaynon. There is a family of Hugh Gaynon and Judy Hogan in Cloughjordan (near Borrisokane) with children Margaret (bap. 30/12/1855), Michael (bap. 22/1/1860) and Denis (bap. 18/5/1862), as well as Timothy and Hugh, but no Mary listed. There is also a family of Patrick Gaynon and Brigid Meara, also Cloughjordan, with children Margaret (bap. 13/1/1857) and Michael (bap. 30/5/1861), as well as Edward, John, Honora, Marianne (bap. 17/5/1865 - could this be Mary?), and Bridget.
				</p>
				<p>
				Note 6:<br />
				In the absence of a marriage record, the connection is unclear between the Kate Cooley who emigrated to Sydney in 1883 and the Kate Preston who was married to  Frederick Preston from 1885 onwards. Evidence for this arises from family oral history giving Kate Preston's maiden name as Cooley, and the information in Kate's obituary regarding immigration and marriage that matches the details for Kate Cooley.
