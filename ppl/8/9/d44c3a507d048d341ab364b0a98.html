			<h4>Narrative</h4>
			<div class="grampsstylednote">
				<p>
				<strong></strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Story</strong></span><strong></strong>
				</p>
				<p>
				There are numerous prior stories written regarding Carl Weber and other members of his family. The following is extracted from “Carl Ludwig Adalbert Weber – Pioneering Surveyor and Engineer”, by Michael Organ. The veracity of elements of this are uncertain, and where relevant footnotes have been added to indicate questions.
				</p>
				<p>
				---<br />
				Carl Weber was born in London in 1852 [Note 1 - birth was actually 1853], the son of Adalbert Arnold Weber and Adelaide Amelia Schleswig [Note 2]. Adalbert had fled to London two years before the birth of his son, because as a Captain in the Prussian Army, he had challenged his Colonel and Captain to a duel, and now faced the possibility of a court-martial. He was also secretly engaged to Adelaide, a Baroness, despite the fact that she was to wed a Prussian prince in an arranged marriage. Because of their connections with the Royal family, England gave the pair a warm welcome.
				</p>
				<p>
				Adalbert and Adelaide spent four years in London, in which time a daughter and a son, Carl, were born. Carl’s godparents were Sir Robert Napier and Lady Emma Duke, who later married Lord Ponsonby, but at the time was one of the maids of honour to Queen Victoria. When Carl was christened in the Lutheran Church in Savoy Street on 27 November, 1853, his godmother took him to see the Queen, who cradled the babe in her arms. She could not have predicted the remarkable career that Carl was to carve out for himself as a surveyor and engineer in the harsh outback of the colony of New South Wales.
				</p>
				<p>
				In 1854, Carl Weber arrived in New South Wales with his mother and sister on the screw steamer, "Croesus". Adalbert had travelled ahead of his family, and because of his connections, had letters of introduction to the Governor and other influential men in Sydney. He was immediately offered a position in a bank, but because he would have had to shave off his beard, declined the offer. Soon after, he received an appointment under Sir Thomas Mitchell, who was both Surveyor General and Chief Engineer of the colony. Over the following years, Adalbert was to lay out and construct roads from the Clyde River to Braidwood, and from the McLeay River at Kempsey to Armidale, and to open up communication for the goldfields at Kiandra.
				</p>
				<p>
				When he turned fourteen, Carl Weber decided that he was capable of starting a life for himself and soon found himself surveying in some of the loneliest parts of the colony. He surveyed previously uncharted rivers, setting up camps as the work demanded. When he was surveying the Endrick River near its union with the Shoalhaven, his food of corned beef and biscuits would be lowered to him over cliffs each evening, and he and his party had only rock shelves to rest on. Later when he camped on the Molonglo River near Queanbeyan, he would spend his evenings with the old shepherds from the nearby Carwoola Rutledges Station, and listen to the horrifying tales of their convict days. Their flogging scars were sickening to him.
				</p>
				<p>
				At the age of twenty-two, Carl was working on the initial surveys of the Sydney Water Supply, and was camped in the Darkes Forest area in a scrubby paddock owned by Mrs Rice, who lived there with her four daughters. Their father was Captain Rice, who spent most of his time at sea. Carl was working in the field all day, and on his calculations late into the night. The worry of the project put him under great stress, and just before Christmas, 1874, his health failed. He lay for some weeks solely dependent on the kindness of Mrs Rice and her eldest daughter, Elizabeth.
				</p>
				<p>
				By the time that Carl was well again, he had asked Mrs Rice for her daughter’s hand in marriage, and had written to Captain Rice on the same subject. Elizabeth and Carl were to enjoy a very happy marriage, Carl later writing, "Life was now one holiday, though I was at the bridge [over the Moruya River] almost ten hours out of twelve, the pleasure of having my darling to see me start and to meet me on my return to dinner and in the evening made the days pass quickly."
				</p>
				<p>
				Illawarra owes much to Carl Weber. He surveyed the top portion of Macquarie Pass, part of the road from Bodalla to Cobargo, the mountain road at Cambewarra over what was called the Good Dog Mountain, the road from Broughton Creek to Kangaroo Valley, and the coastal road from Clifton to Stanwell Park, where men had to be lowered over the cliff for the initial excavations. Importantly, he supervised the building of the first lookout at Bulli Pass, which for a long time was known as Weber’s Lookout. Carl Ludwig Adalbert Weber died in 1923, outliving his beloved Elizabeth by twenty years. He was survived by three sons and four daughters.<br />
				---
				</p>
				<p>
				Apart from the above details there are numerous other bits of trivia – a few of which are mentioned here.
				</p>
				<p>
				Carl’s trip from the UK to Australia (as a 1 year old) was on board the Croesus. This was the ship’s maiden voyage and she had numerous problems. When the ship returned to England she then became a troop ship carrying troops to the Crimean war, but then sank (in April 1855) on her second voyage, off Portofino, Italy [Note 3].
				</p>
				<p>
				Carl married his wife Elizabeth Duke Rice at St Marks Church, Appin, on 13th January 1875. Both were living in “Dark’s Forest” at the time.
				</p>
				<p>
				At various periods during the 1890’s he served as a returning officer for various elections.
				</p>
				<p>
				In March 1910, Carl became the president of the Wollongong Homing Pigeon Society
				</p>
				<p>
				Carl died at Pioneer Road, Corrimal, on 12th April 1923 (the death certificate indicates “malignant disease of the liver; and cardiac syncope” that lasted 6 months). He was buried in Sutherland Cemetery (now Woronora Cemetery) on 13th April 1923.
				</p>
				<p>
				---
				</p>
				<p>
				Note 1:<br />
				This year is wrong. Carl's baptism record clearly gives his birth as 11/10/1853.<br />
				The Savoy Chapel was built from 1490 to 1512 and subsequently hosted numerous congregations, often simultaneously. From 1549 to 1714 it hosted the Anglican parish of St Mary-le-Strand (which subsequently moved to a new church in the Strand) and in 1939 the Savoy Chapel became known as The Kings Chapel of the Savoy (and then The Queens Chapel of the Savoy).<br />
				The German Lutheran congregation of St Mary-le-Savoy was formed in 1694 as the 2nd German congregation in London. From 1694 to 1875 it was hosted in the Savoy Chapel, and then in 1877 moved to Cleveland St. Bloomsbury, and in 1949 to Sandwich St, WC1 near St Pancras.
				</p>
				<p>
				Note 2:<br />
				This surname seems wrong. Elsewhere Carl’s mother is referred to as “Schliesz”, not “Schleswig”.
				</p>
				<p>
				Note 3:<br />
