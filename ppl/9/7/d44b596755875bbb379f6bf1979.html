				<p>
				<strong></strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Story</strong></span>
				</p>
				<p>
				<em>Connecting context: Bridget Dundon’s 1858 marriage record (to Charles Miller Lowe) lists her parents as John Dundon (Farmer) and Mary ??Conan. A newspaper notice at the same time indicates that her father has just arrived in the colony with her sisters, and there is only one matching immigration record.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
				John was likely born around 1817 in County Clare, Ireland [Note 1]. He is likely to have married around 1835 to Mary (surname is unclear – Carton? Canon?). John and Mary had at least three daughters:
				</p>
				<p>
				-	Mary, b. 1835<br />
				-	Bridget, b. ~1836, Foynes, Limerick<br />
				-	Anne, b. ~1839
				</p>
				<p>
				In 1854 (just prior to the great famine), as an 18yo, Bridget emigrated to Australia, arriving on 29th April 1854, aboard the Merchantman.  The immigration records show that she was from Limerick, aged 18, her religion was R.C., and she could read and write.
				</p>
				<p>
				It is likely that in the following few years John (or his remaining daughters) endeavoured to remain in contact with Bridget, as there is a 1856 notice of an unclaimed letter in Melbourne for Bridget.
				</p>
				<p>
				In 1858 (in the middle of the great famine), John and his two daughters Mary and Anne followed Bridget to Victoria. There is no mention of his wife Mary, so she may have died prior to this. They arrived on 13th April 1858 aboard the ship Arabian. All three are listed as having come from Co. Clare. Mary is listed as having been engaged by “Mrs Y Scone(?), Deep Creek, on May 6. Anne is listed as having “gone with Sister to Queensberry St. N. M”.
				</p>
				<p>
				Shortly after John and his daughters arrived in Melbourne, but before they had found Bridget she married Charles Miller Lowe (in Beechworth on 6th July 1858). John was clearly trying to find Bridget, as in July 1858 there was a series of newspaper notices in the Ovens and Murray Advertiser:
				</p>
				<p>
				"<em>Mrs Charles Lowe, - formerly Miss Bridget Dundon. – Please write to your Father and Sisters, who have arrived and are now in the Depot, Melbourne</em>". [Note 2] 
				</p>
				<p>
				No subsequent record for Mary has been located [Note 3], but the following year, in 1859, Anne married Charles Lampitt and appears to have lived in Beechworth and then Albury. Charles died in 1900 in Albury [Note 4].
				</p>
				<p>
				There are no records for John Dundon from this point until the 1870’s, when a diary written by grandson John Charles Lowe (son of John’s daughter Bridget) makes mention of John living with Charles and Bridget Lowe in Benalla:
				</p>
				<p>
				<em>"At this time [early 1870’s] my grandfather (my mother’s father) was living with us [in Benalla]. He used to cart wood and did jobs of carting about the town and I took to going with him for wood and he had bought me a pony previously and I used to look after his cows, of which he always had a few. … In 1876  </em>[Note 5]<em> my grandfather died and left his horse and dray to me. The horse being a new one he had just bought; a 3 year old and not properly broken in".</em>
				</p>
				<p>
				John died on 16th April 1878 in Benalla. He died without leaving a will, but probate papers do provide some details. Of most interest is the affidavit of his daughter Bridget:
				</p>
				<p>
				<em>"I Bridget Lowe (formerly Bridget Dundon) wife of Charles Lowe of Arundel Street Benalla in the colony of Victoria Carpenter make oath and say</em><br />
				<em>"That John Dundon late of Benalla in the colony of Victoria labourer deceased departed this life on the (16th) sixteenth day of April One thousand eight hundred and seventy eight Intestate</em><br />
				<em>"That he left me the said Bridget Lowe aged forty one years his lawful eldest child and Annie Lampitt (formerly Annie Dundon) aged thirty nine years wife of Charles Lampitt of Beechworth in the colony of Victoria Engineer his only other child him surviving and we are the only persons entitled to a distribution of his property".</em>
				</p>
				<p>
				The probate records also record John as having no liabilities, and the following assets:
				</p>
				<p>
				- Real Estate:<br />
					All that piece of land being Allotment Ten Section L at Benalla [Note 6] on which is erected a slab hut unoccupied and unimproved - £20.0.0<br />
				- Personal Estate: <br />
					Horse Dray and Harness - £40.0.0<br />
					Cash in Bank - £40.0.0
				</p>
				<p>
				John is likely to be buried in Benalla cemetery but the records are unclear [Note 7].
				</p>
				<p>
				---
				</p>
				<p>
				Note 1:<br />
				This is from the 1858 immigration record, which shows him as coming from Co. Clare, and aged 41.
				</p>
				<p>
				Note 2:<br />
				The “Immigration Depot” stood on the corner of Collins and Spencer street, Melbourne, and was used to house female immigrants who did not have anywhere else to stay when they first arrived.
				</p>
				<p>
				Note 3:<br />
				One possibility is that there was an M. Dundon who left Victoria for Otago in Aug 1861. The probate papers for John in 1876 indicate that Bridget and Anne are the only surviving children of John.
