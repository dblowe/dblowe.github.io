				<strong></strong><span style="text-decoration:underline;"><strong>Story</strong></span>
				</p>
				<p>
				<em>Connecting Context: John Charles Lowe, was born in Victoria in 1862 to Charles Lowe and Bridget Dundon. The 1858 marriage certificate for Charles M. Lowe and Bridget Dundon lists Bridget as 22 years old, her parents as John Dundon (Farmer) and Mary ??Canan, and her origin as Foynes – Limerick, Ireland.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
				Bridget was likely born around 1836 [Note 1] to John Dundon and Mary (Canon?). Her marriage record indicates that she was born in Foynes [Note 2], a town around 38km west of Limerick in western Ireland. She had at least one older sister Mary and one younger sister Anne.
				</p>
				<p>
				In 1854, as an 18yo, Bridget emigrated to Australia, arriving on 29th April 1854, aboard the Merchantman.  The immigration records show that she was from Limerick, aged 18, her religion was R.C., and she could read and write.
				</p>
				<p>
				No record of Bridget can be found for the next few years but in 1858 Bridget’s father John (41yo), and sisters Mary (23yo) and Anne (19yo) arrived in Melbourne. On 13th April 1858 they arrived aboard the ship Arabian. All three are listed as having come from Co. Clare (not Co. Limerick!). 	Mary is listed as having been engaged by “Mrs Y Scone(?), Deep Creek, on May 6). Anne is listed as having “gone with Sister to Queensberry St. N. M”.  No subsequent record for Mary has been located [Note 3], but the following year, in 1859, Anne married Charles Lampitt and appears to have lived in Beechworth and then Albury. Charles died in 1900 in Albury [Note 4].
				</p>
				<p>
				On 6th July 1858 Bridget married Charles Miller Lowe in Beechworth. Charles had arrived in 1852 as a miner (though with a Blacksmithing background). They were married in the Empire Hotel (which still exists) by John Grant, according to the Presbyterian rite. Charles listed his occupation as a miner, and both Charles and Bridget are described as normally residing in Reid’s creek (about 9km north of Beechworth, and the site of the original gold find in 1852). The marriage record indicates that Bridget was 22yo (indicating she was born in the period 7/1835-7/1836) and born in Foynes, Ireland.
				</p>
				<p>
				Almost immediately after the wedding a series of advertisements appeared in the Ovens and Murray Advertiser:
				</p>
				<p>
				"<em>Mrs Charles Lowe, - formerly Miss Bridget Dundon. – Please write to your Father and Sisters, who have arrived and are now in the Depot, Melbourne</em>". [Note 5] 
				</p>
				<p>
				In the year following their wedding, as reported in several newspaper articles, both Charles and Bridget were witnesses in a murder trial, as the defendant had visited them on the morning following the murder. Charles is described as residing at Black Dog, and being a blacksmith, and in one of the articles is referred to as Charles Low.
				</p>
				<p>
				Over the ensuing years [Note 6], Charles and Bridget had the following children:
				</p>
				<p>
				-	Mary Ann, b. 1858: No birth record can be found, but the death record indicates a likely birth year of 1858, which could put the date of birth less than 9 months after the marriage (which might explain why there is no birth record)!<br />
				-	John Charles, b. 1862, Lime (near Chiltern)<br />
				-	Ellen Miller, b. 1864, Estcourt (8km north of Wangaratta)<br />
				-	Lilian Margaret, b. 1868, Wangaratta<br />
				-	Thomas Edward, b. 1871; d. 1907, Yarrawonga<br />
				-	Rosina, b. 1872, Benalla<br />
				-	Lucy, b. 1875, Benalla<br />
				-	Charles Miller, b. 1877, Benalla; d. 1927
				</p>
				<p>
				Charles and Bridget’s son John wrote a diary that describes the family’s movements from the time he was born in 1861. At this time the family was living at Black Dog Creek, near Chiltern. A year later the family moved to Docker's Plains / Estcourt where, on 2/3/1863, Charles selected 65.53ha of land at Boorhaman, 20km north of Wangaratta [Note 7]. Charles then sold the land and moved to Wangaratta sometime between 1865 and 1868.
				</p>
				<p>
				A newspaper record from July 1866 lists Charles as the defendant in a court case brought by Anton Stack, for the sale of "<em>Eight Thousand Bricks (more or less)</em>". In August 1866 another newspaper reports Charles unsuccessfully running in a council election, for the North Ovens Road District. He ran 5th out of 6 candidates.
				</p>
				<p>
				Two years later, in July 1868, Charles (still listed as being from Estcourt) was back in the Wangaratta Police Court, this time being convicted and fined £6, for selling spirits without a licence.
				</p>
				<p>
				Around 1872 the family moved to Benalla where they remained for around a decade. Bridget’s father John Dundon was also living with the family during this time, prior to his death in 1878. The probate record for John Dundon indicates that the family was living in Arundel Street, that Bridget was his eldest daughter [Note 8], there was only one other living child (Annie) and that Charles was working as a carpenter.
				</p>
				<p>
				In 1881 Charles moved to Jingellic to work in a tin mine, and shortly after this Bridget and the younger children followed (John and his two older sisters remained in Benalla). At some point prior to 1884 Charles and Bridget moved to Wagga Wagga.
				</p>
				<p>
				On 9/2/1884 a newspaper reported Bridget Lowe unsuccessfully applying for a court order “prohibiting publicans from supplying [Charles] with liquor”. She indicated that she had three children at home (presumably Rosina, Lucy and Charles Jnr), that her husband was regularly drunk, and that he “was wasting his means, leaving his family destitute, and impairing his own health”. On 13/12/1884 they were back in court, but in this case the parties did not appear (and presumably the case was therefore dismissed).
				</p>
				<p>
				On 7/1/1885, Charles was charged with having assaulted his married daughter, Mary Ann Chicken. The article reports that Charles came home one evening and try to collect his things to leave so he could “live separately”. His wife Bridget and daughter Mary Ann attempted to stop him and he assaulted them. The court case refers to “a general family quarrel between the parties”. The case was dismissed.
				</p>
				<p>
				Charles and Bridget eventually moved back south to Yarrawonga and lived with their son John. An article in the Yarrawonga Chronicle [Note 9] stated: 
				</p>
				<p>
				"<em>About the same time [mid 1880’s] there came another family, bearing the name of Lowe. Passing through to hunt kangaroos on ‘Nowranie’ in 1878, John C. Lowe liked the place and returned, later bringing his father, mother, two brothers, and two sisters (one of who is Mrs Ted Crilly). His brothers, Charles and Tom, were expert horse drovers and drove coaches into Riverina, but both were also carpenters and worked at their trade for many years</em>".

				Presumably, at this stage, of Charles and Bridget’s 8 children, Mary Anne remained in Wagga with her husband, 5 of the children (definitely John, Tom, Charles, and Rosina [Note 10], and probably Lucy given that she would only have been ~10yo at this point [Note 11]) were in Yarrawonga, and two of the daughters (probably 21yo Ellen and 17yo Lillian [Note 12]) were elsewhere.
				</p>
				<p>
				The Yarrawonga Chronicle article indicates that Bridget did originally move to Yarrawonga in the mid 1880’s, but she is then absent from the 1903 electoral roll for Yarrawonga (which does list her husband Charles, along with various of her children). Charles died in Yarrawonga on 24th April 1906 at the age of 76. 
				</p>
				<p>
				The only subsequent record for Bridget is her death in 1922 in Sydney. Bridget appears to have moved to Sydney with her sister Ann Lampitt (and maybe her daughter Mary Ane Chicken, as Mary Ann possibly died in Sydney). Bridget died on 18th Feb 1822 in Sydney, and was buried at Rookwood cemetery on 20th Feb 1822 [Note 13]. Her sister Ann died two and half years later and was buried in the same plot as Bridget on 20th August 1824.

				Note 1:<br />
				The indicators of her year of birth (any of which may be wrong) are:<br />
				-	Immigration: aged 18 on 29/4/1854 – suggests born 4/1835 - 4/1836<br />
				-	Marriage: aged 22 on 6/7/1858 – suggests born 7/1835 – 7/1836<br />
				-	Father’s probate: aged 41 on 16/4/1878 – suggests born 4/1836 – 4/1837<br />
				Note also that a separate Ancestry tree shows her birth as 18/11/1836, Foynes, Co. Clare (http://person.ancestry.com.au/tree/24468029/person/12491571703/facts) with siblings Philip b. 8/2/1829, Michael, b. 14/7/1838 (both b. Co. Clare – but not clear where). This tree does however contain some inconsistencies – i.e. shows father as Patrick who died in Ireland, which is clearly contradicted by the evidence of her father John emigrating to Australia.
				</p>
				<p>
				There is also some confusion over the spelling of the surname, with some online trees listing it as Dunden or Dundan. Her marriage record seems to list the name as Dundon, though it could be misread as Dundan. There are however numerous other records that list Dundon, including for her father John and sisters who emigrated after her.
				</p>
				<p>
				&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
				Note 2:<br />
				The parish records for Foynes (http://registers.nli.ie/parishes/0866) do not have a relevant baptism record for Bridget in the period 7/1835-7/1836. It may be that the age was wrong? Or that Bridget was baptised somewhere else (particularly given that her father and sisters are listed on their immigration records as coming from Co. Clare).
				</p>
				<p>
				Note 3:<br />
				One possibility is that there was an M. Dundon who left Victoria for Otago in Aug 1861
				</p>
				<p>
				Note 4:<br />
				See http://person.ancestry.com.au/tree/6099001/person/934510809/facts
				</p>
				<p>
				Note 5:<br />
				The “Immigration Depot” stood on the corner of Collins and Spencer street, Melbourne, and was used to house female immigrants who did not have anywhere else to stay when they first arrived.
				</p>
				<p>
				Note 6:<br />
				Care needs to be taken with interpreting records for the second half of the 1800’s as there is another Bridget Lowe (living in Huntly just north of Bendigo) during this period. This Bridget was originally Bridget Ryan, and was a publican in Huntly.
				</p>
				<p>
				Note 7:<br />
				See land map, 2599: Parish of Estcourt, allotment 296; Name = C. Lowe; Area = 65.53ha; Date = 2-3-1863; Plan = E69-2. Also, see https://goo.gl/maps/SBnXqGjEj1D2.
				</p>
				<p>
				Note 8:<br />
				This seems to contradict the age of Mary Dundon – unless Mary had died or left the colony and this was referring to Bridget being the oldest living daughter.
				</p>
				<p>
				Note 9:<br />
				See records for the son John Charles Lowe.
				</p>
				<p>
				Note 10:<br />
				Rosina married Pat Crilly in 1895, and died in Bion, Vic. in 1942.
				</p>
				<p>
				Note 11:<br />
				No subsequent records have been found for Lucy, though a Miss L Lowe (22yo) travelled from Melbourne to Fremantle aboard Adelaide II in Nov 1896.
				</p>
				<p>
				Note 12:<br />
				Lillian was married to Robert Merrick in 1886  in Wagga, by 1895 was living in Sydney (from birth record of daughter Mildred) and died in Yarrawonga in 1907.
