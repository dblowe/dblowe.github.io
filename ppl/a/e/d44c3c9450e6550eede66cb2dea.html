				<em>Connecting Context:</em><br />
				<em>The death record for Elizabeth Duke Weber (nee Rice) gives her parents as William Duke Rice, Retired Master Mariner and Honoria Pendergast.</em>
				</p>
				<p>
				&nbsp;
				</p>
				<p>
				William Duke Rice was born in Newark Upon Trent, Nottingham, England on 26th October 1824 [note 1], and baptised on 28th October 1824. He was probably the second of at least eight children to Thomas Rice and Elizabeth Duke. Thomas was born ~1790 in Barton in Fabis, Nottinghamshire and died in Newark in 1865. Elizabeth was born in Southwell, Nottinghamshire ~1790. They were married in Barton in Fabis in 1812. Jemima (~1816) was born in Clifton), and then the following children were born in Newark upon Trent: John (bap. 1820-6-11), Caroline (bap. 1822-10-4), William (bap. 1824-10-28), Samuel (bap. 1827-7-15), Ann (bap. 1830-6-8), Henry (bap. 1834-6-11), Mary (bap. 1834-6-11, d. 1839-1-22).
				</p>
				<p>
				By 1841 William, 17yo, was working as a Waterman in Newark upon Trent [note 2]. The 1841 census shows the family living in Mill Gate, Newark upon Trent: Thomas (50yo, Waterman), Elizabeth (50yo), Jemima (25yo, ?maker), Caroline (20yo, Straw Brush?maker), William (17yo, waterman), Samuel (13yo), Ann (11yo), Henry (7yo). 
				</p>
				<p>
				A merchant navy record for William shows that he received his 'seaman's ticket' at age 21, on 24th Aug 1846 (register ticket #345,935) [note 3]. The record indicates that he was born at Newark on 26/10/1825 [note 1], he was a Seaman. More interestingly, it indicates that he first went to sea as a boy in the year 1837 (so when he was only 12/13 years old). It also indicates that when unemployed he resides at Newark. He appears to have been at see between 3/9/1846 and 31/5/1847, probably travelling between London and Berwick.
				</p>
				<p>
				At some point between 1847 (when he was in the merchant navy) and 1855 (when he was married) William emigrated to Australia. It is likely it was in the early 1850's but no immigration record has been found possibly because William came to Australia as a crew member [note 4].
				</p>
				<p>
				On the 28th Feb 1855 William married Honora Prendergast [note 5] in the Parish of St James, Sydney, with the service being carried out by Charles F. D. Priddle. William was resident in the Parish of St Phillip (this covers the western side of Sydney, including the Rocks, Wynyard, etc.) and Honora was from the Parish of St James (the eastern side of the city). Over the next 6 years William and Honora had four daughters: Elizabeth Duke Rice (b. 1856-3-4, Broughton Creek - d. 1903-4-11), Mysie Eleanor (b. 1857, Sydney - d. 1939-9-23), Clara Sophie Rice (1859, Sydney - d. 1940-6-27), and Letitia Geraldine Rice (1861, Sydney - 1896-12-20). Elizabeth was the only one of the daughters to marry (to Carl Weber in 1875).
				</p>
				<p>
				In 1856, shortly after marrying, a newspaper article indicates that William was working as a waterman at Circular Quay in Sydney (Sydney's population at this stage was around 50,000).  His brother Samuel then arrived in the colony in 1862.
				</p>
				<p>
				By 1864 (though possibly earlier) he was the co-owner (with William Hexlett) and master of the ship Terrara (a newspaper article from 1864 refers to William running into a yacht in Wolloomoloo Bay), and William ended up spending considerable time sailing up and down the NSW coast, including much time around the Clarence, Richmond and Macleay rivers in Northern NSW.
				</p>
				<p>
				In 1867 William was master of the Amphitrite, sailing it from Leith (near Edinburgh) to Sydney with a crew of 7, arriving on 28/10/1867.
				</p>
				<p>
				In 1868 he sailed the Terrara from Sydney heading for the Macleay River, but on the morning of 5th Feb the ship foundered and sank twelve miles from shore off Port Stephens. William and the crew managed to reach Narrowgut Lighthouse Island (now Fingal Island) in a lifeboat.
				</p>
				<p>
				William then appears to have returned to captaining the Amphitrite. There are records for him captaining it from Adelaide to Sydney (10/3/1869), Dunedin to Sydney (18/11/1871), Maryborough to Sydney (20/6/1872), and Onkaparinga to Sydney (8/7/1873). During these trips his younger brother Samuel is listed as his Mate.
				</p>
				<p>
				At some point in the 1860 or early 1870's William is likely to have bought property around Darkes Forest, north of Wollongong as information on Carl Weber (who married William's daughter Elizabeth) indicates that whilst working on the initial surveys of the Sydney Water Supply in late 1874 he was camped in a scrubby paddock owned by Honora Rice, who was living at Darkes Forest with her four daughters. In January 1875 Carl married Elizabeth.
				</p>
				<p>
				In early March 1875 William's younger brother Samuel, who was by then the master of the "three-masted schooner Sarah Nicholl", was sailing from Port Macquarie to Sydney with a cargo of timber. The ship was wrecked off the Bellinger River Heads (south of Coffs Harbour) and Samuel was lost along with all of the crew (5 lives lost).
				</p>
				<p>
				It is likely that William was away during both his daughter's marriage and his brothers death, as he only arrived back in Sydney from London, on 29/4/1875 captaining the ship Wallacetown.
				</p>
				<p>
				By 1878 William was master of the ship Platypus (an iron screw steamer, the property of the Clarence and Richmond Steam Navigation Company) and when sailing from Sydney to the Richmond river was damaged after becoming stranded on a bar in the Richmond River. In a subsequent inquiry, "the Marine Board decided that no blame is attributable to William Rice, the master".
				</p>
				<p>
				Ten years later, in 1889, the schooner Neptune was wrecked off the Gippsland coast. A newspaper report (The Richmond River Herald and Northern Districts Advertiser, Fri 1 Mar 1889) reported: "Captain Rice reports that the schooner had 400 cases of dynamite on board, and it appears that on the fatal morning she reached a place about 13 miles east of the mouth of the Snowy River, along the Ninety-Mile Beach, when the captain suddenly found himself in difficulties amidst a double row of breakers close in shore. In explanation of his position the captain states that thick and rainy weather prevailed, and it was only when daylight appeared that he could accurately ascertain where the schooner was. When he saw the close proximity of the coast he had the helm put down, but in going round to the eastward she struck the rocks astern. The sea immediately began to dash over her, and as she soon began to break up it was decided to get ashore as speedily as possible. The two boats were accordingly put over on the lee side, and the captain, mate, and five men composing the crew made for the beach. This they eventually reached in safety, but not without a severe struggle with the breakers, in the course of which one of the boats was overturned. Notwithstanding this experience, however, some of the men afterwards succeeded in again boarding the schooner and securing their clothes. The part of the coast upon which they were cast proved exceedingly inhospitable. Beyond the beach nothing but a dense rough scrub could be discerned for miles, and there were no signs of human habitation. Between 9 and 10 o'clock the beating of the tide fell so heavily upon the wreck that she rapidly burst asunder and quantities of her cargo were washed ashore, including, as luck would have it, ample supplies of provisions. An hour later she had disappeared altogether. The master and crew managed to reach Orbost, and their travelling expenses to Melbourne were defrayed by the Victorian Government. There are said to be nearly 100 cases of dynamite saved from the wreck, stacked on the beach where the crew landed, awaiting removal. A Court of Marine Inquiry was held at Melbourne on Wednesday to investigate the loss of the Neptune, which became a total wreck. The vessel left Melbourne for this river, via Sydney, on the 2nd instant, with 400 cases of dynamite and 52 tons of ballast. The Court found that the vessel was lost through the default of the master, William Rice, and considered his certificate should be suspended for a period of two years from February 6. They also found that the mate, William Hodgson, was in default, and considered that his certificate should be suspended for 12 months from the same date. Steps will be taken, in the interests of the public safety, to destroy the dynamite washed<br />
				up on the beach".
				</p>
				<p>
				By 1890 it was likely that William (and his family) was living in Sylvania, as an archive photo shows William sailing on the Georges River with his dog.
				</p>
				<p>
				In the later years of his shipping career he was in charge of the steamers of Mr. Wm. T. Yonger - including at one point returning to England to superintend the building of the ship Oakland. According to his obituary he retired around 1899.
				</p>
				<p>
				William died on 24th August 1909, aged 84, at Sylvania in Sydney. On his death certificate his profession was given as retired master mariner. His death was certified by his daughter Clara Sophie Rice or Illawarra Rd., Sylvania and certified by Carl Weber. William was buried on 25th Aug 1909 at the Church of England Cemetery, Sutherland (now known as Woronora Cemetery). One of William's obituaries (The Richmond River Express and Casino Kyogle Advertiser) stated:
				</p>
				<p>
				Captain William Rice, retired master mariner, who died at Sylvania on August 24, was well known and highly respected. He was a man of sterling worth and kindly and reserved disposition. In the shipping circles of his time he was esteemed as an upright man and a brave and skilful sailor. Old residents of the Clarence, Richmond and Macleay will hear with regret of his death. Captain Rice spent 50 years at sea, but retired ten years ago. He arrived in Sydney in the fifties and was a ship-owner and master mariner for many years. He was shipping partner of the late Wm. Hexlett, M.P. He spent the last years of his seafaring life in charge of the steamers of Mr. Wm. T. Yonger. He had charge of the ships Terara, Amphitrite, and Neptune, Platypus, Wyoming, and Oakland. He superintended the building of the last named in England. The remains were interred in the Church of England cemetery, Sutherland. The funeral service was performed by Revs. Anderson and Hilhouse Taylor. Captain Rice was born at Newark, England in 1824. He was the son of Thomas Rice, master mariner and ship owner of that port. His widow, two daughters, and seven grandchildren survive him.
				</p>
				<p>
				Honora died four years later on 1st October 1913 and was buried with William at Woronora cemetery.
				</p>

				<p>
				Note 1: The baptism record gives a baptism date (28/10/1824) but does not give a date of birth, nor does the marriage or death records. The only indication of a date of birth is on the merchant navy ticket from 21/8/1846 which gives the d.o.b as 26/10/1825, however his age is listed as 21 (he would only be 20 if he was born in Oct 1825). Given the similarity in dates, and the discrepancy in age, It is likely that the year is an error, which would indicate that he was born 2 days before the baptism - a likely scenario.

				</p>
				<p>
				Note 4:<br />
				William's death record from 1909 indicates he had been in NSW for 57 years (putting his arrival around 1852) and an obituary states that "He arrived in Sydney in the fifties". Given his previous history as a waterman and in the merchant navy it may be that he arrived as a crew member rather than a passenger.
				</p>
				<p>
				Note 5:<br />
				The marriage record gives Honora's name as Honoria Pendergrast, but all other records give the name as Honora (or sometime Honor) Prendergast.
